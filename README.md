# -Chatbot
University Health Center Chatbot

To run the chatbot, 
we have main files; train_chatbot.py 

First, we train the model using the command in the terminal:   python train_chatbot.py

If we donâ€™t see any error during training, we have successfully created the model. 
Then to run the app, the gui code file will be update soon.
